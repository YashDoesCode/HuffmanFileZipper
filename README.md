# HuffmanFileZipper (Legacy)

I built this Huffman file zipper in Java back in 2021 as my first data structures project. It’s a simple tool for compressing and decompressing files using classic Huffman coding. I’m sharing it now in 2025 so others can learn or adapt the idea. The code is clean, straightforward, and easy to follow. If you’re just getting started with algorithms or Java, feel free to check it out or use it in your own work.

I’ve recently restarted working on this project to rebuild and update it, ensuring it stays relevant in today’s rapidly evolving AI and ML landscape. New features and improvements will be coming soon as I adapt it to modern industry needs.
